# Online-Voting-System
I developed an online voting system for the Institute of Information Technology Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. This was my database system course project. I used Python and MySQL for this project. The system features a basic Python interface. The functionalities include user signup and registration, followed by login. Each voter ID can cast a vote only once. The admin can log in, register candidates for the elections, delete candidates, view voting results, and see registered students.
